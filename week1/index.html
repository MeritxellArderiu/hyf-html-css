<h1>Welcome to my web resume</h1> <!--This is the first heading of the page. It is only to be used once.-->
<p>Hi! Hej! My name is Meritxell and I am an Architect and Landscape Architect based in Denmark. At the moment I am learning and having fun with web development, and this is what I am showing in this web resume. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed building it.</p>

<p class="centered-text">Here it goes, my first website!</p>

<h2 class="injected-text">Profile</h2>
<p>Apart from Architecture and Design, I like drawing and learning new things. It sounds a little bit funny that I am now interested in learning web development, but to me, it looks like there are some similarities between these two professions: 
        <ul>
            <li>structure</li>
            <li>beauty</li>
            <li>and fun</li>
        </ul></p>

<h2 class="injected-text">Education</h2>
<p>I hold a M.Sc.in Architecture by the Escola Tecnica Superior d'Arquitectura de Barcelona - Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya <a href="https://etsab.upc.edu/en/studies">(ETSAB)</a>, and a Master degree in Landscape Architecture by the Ecole Nationale Superieure de Paysage de Versailles- Marseille <a href="http://www.ecole-paysage.fr/site/ensp_en/">(ENSPV).</a>
</p>

<h2 class="injected-text">Work experience</h2>
<p>I am a trained Architect, with some years of experience in the field of construction, but I have been developing some other type of jobs, which I enjoyed and liked doing:
        <ul>
            <li>Scouts leader</li>
            <li>Librarian</li>
            <li>English and maths teacher</li>
            <li>... the list is long...</li>
            <li>...maybe Web Developer is the next one?</li>
        </ul></p>
</p>
